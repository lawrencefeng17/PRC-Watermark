The old mansion loomed before them, its turrets and spires reaching towards the moon like skeletal fingers. The investigators, a team of seasoned detectives led by the determined and sharp-witted Jameson, had been called to the place to unravel the mystery of the gruesome murder that had shaken the community.

The victim, Richard Langley, a wealthy businessman and owner of the mansion, had been found bludgeoned to death in his study. The police had collected evidence, took statements, and processed the crime scene, but the enormity of the crime still hung in the air.

As the team began to survey the scene, they noticed something peculiar - a faint scratch on the windowsill, near the spot where Langley's body lay. It looked like a matchstick, a common carpenter's tool, and yet, it seemed too deliberate to be mere chance.

"Guys, I think we have a lead," Jameson whispered to his team, his eyes sparkling with excitement. "This scratch could be our key to unraveling the case."

The team exchanged skeptical glances, but Jameson continued, "We need to keep digging. Let's start by interviewing the staff. See if anyone noticed anything unusual on the night of the murder."

The next day, the team arrived at Langley's mansion, armed with cameras, polygraph tests, and a keen eye for detail. They began their interview, paying special attention to the staff members who had worked for Langley.

Mrs. White, the Westley family's devoted housekeeper, seemed nervous and on edge. "I was getting ready for bed when I heard a loud crash from the study," she stammered. "I rushed in to find Richard lying on the floor. I didn't see anyone else around that night."

"Did you see anyone else around the study?" Jameson asked, his pen poised over his notebook.

Mrs. White hesitated, as if unsure how much to reveal. "Well, there was...a visitor. But he left soon after. I didn't see his face, but I did notice he wore a silver watch with a broken crown." Mrs. White's eyes dropped, and she seemed to shudder at the memory.

Dr. Lee, the family physician, spoke in a hushed tone, referring to a "lantern incident" from the previous night. "I was working late when a visitor came to offer my condolences. He was wearing a silver watch, just like Mrs. White mentioned. He told me about Richard's...illness. He left abruptly, without warning me."

The team processed the information, wondering if there was a connection between the visitors and the murder.

As they continued their investigation, they discovered more disturbing facts. Langley had been blackmailing several people in the community, using secret files and compromising information to extort money from them. It seemed that his murder was more than just a random act of violence.

One of the detectives, Maria, made a startling discovery - a hidden safe in Langley's study. As she opened the door, a faint smell of lavender wafted out, and a single letter slipped out, addressed to an unknown recipient. It was a note detailing Langley's plans to expose a dark secret and spark a chain reaction of revelations that could bring down several prominent figures in the community.

"Guys, I think we have the motive and the means," Maria exclaimed, desperation creeping into her voice. "But we need to find the killer and get to the bottom of this case."

Jameson's eyes widened as he gazed at the note. "This is it. We have to follow the trail." He began to outline a detailed plan to track down the killer and unmask the guilty party.

As the investigators delved deeper into the mystery, they encountered more twists and turns. They found a broken bottle near the crime scene, attributed to a flask, but the types of glass and the oxidized matte surface suggested it wasn't from the area.

It was on the team's third day in the mansion that they stumbled upon a hidden logbook belonging to one of the staff members, Harold Bennett. He had been working in the mansion for over 20 years, starting as a young footman and rising through the ranks. Initially, Jameson thought Bennett might be an intriguing suspect, given his passion for books and antique items.

However, as the team continued to inspect the mansion, they discovered several inconsistencies in Bennett's alibi, pointing to an alibi with insufficiently reliable paperwork. "He might be suffering from a vivid reality distortion. And those books he told me about?" But just as they were convinced, Bennett's name was removed from the list of belongings to be discovered upon the Langley's death.

On the very next day of the investigation, visions swept through the mansion as "blinks" referred to https mg
