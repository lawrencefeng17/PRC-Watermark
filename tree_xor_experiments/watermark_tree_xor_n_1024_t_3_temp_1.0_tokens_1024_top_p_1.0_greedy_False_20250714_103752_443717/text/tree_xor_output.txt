* **Accessibility:** Adherence to WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) to ensure usability for users with disabilities.
* **Onboarding:**  A streamlined onboarding process guiding new users through the platform's key features.


**6. Technical Design**

* **Backend:**
    * **Language:** Python (with Flask or Django framework) - Chosen for its robust ecosystem and suitability for real-time applications.
    * **Database:** PostgreSQL - Reliable, scalable, and ACID-compliant database for storing user data, content, and relationships.
    * **Cloud Infrastructure:** AWS (Amazon Web Services) - Chosen for its scalability, reliability, and wide range of services – including EC2 for compute, S3 for storage, RDS for database, and Lambda for serverless functions.
    * **Caching:** Redis - For caching frequently accessed data and improving performance, particularly for the feed and search APIs.
    * **Real-Time Communication:** WebSockets (using Socket.IO) for real-time updates to the feed and user interactions.
* **Frontend:**
    * **Framework:** React -  A component-based JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. Vue.js or Angular could also be considered, but React offers a quicker development cycle and a large community.
    * **State Management:** Redux (for larger applications) or Context API (for simpler apps) - To manage application state efficiently.
    * **UI Libraries:** Material UI or Ant Design - Provides pre-built, styled components that enhance the visual design and reduce development time.
* **API Design:** RESTful APIs for communication between the frontend and backend.  GraphQL could be considered for improved data fetching efficiency.
* **Security:**
    * **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication and authorization.
    * **Data Encryption:**  HTTPS for all communication.  Encryption at rest for database data.
    * **Input Validation:**  Robust input validation to prevent security vulnerabilities (e.g., cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection).
    * **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
    * **Content Moderation:**  Utilize a combination of automated detection and human moderation to ensure a safe and positive environment.


**7. Content Moderation & Community Guidelines**

* **Clear Guidelines:**  A comprehensive set of community guidelines outlining acceptable behavior, content standards, and consequences for violations.
* **Reporting System:**  A user-friendly reporting system for flagging inappropriate content.
* **Automated Detection:**  Utilize AI-powered tools (including machine learning models) to automatically detect and flag potentially harmful content (e.g., hate speech, violence, nudity).
* **Human Moderation:**  A team of human moderators to review flagged content and take appropriate action.
* **Community-Driven Enforcement:** Empower community members to participate in content moderation through reputation systems and reward systems.



**8. Monetization Strategy (Phase 1 - Initial Launch)**
