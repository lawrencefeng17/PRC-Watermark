Fork of Image Watermarking with PRC

# What's in here?

* attacks on image watermarking with PRC, testing robustness, similarity of latents after edits
* we can scrub the PRC watermark on images by seeding a proxy diffusion model with the reversed latent of a watermarked image using the proxy diffusion model

* *In Progress:* Implementation of Watermarking Scheme for Language Models from "Pseudorandom Error-Correcting Codes" b CG24.
