  Let the silence of the old mansion unfold it.
The snowflakes gently fell onto the mansion's overgrown grounds, casting a serene silence over the once grand estate.  The trees stood tall and still, their branches stretching up towards the pale moonlight.  But amidst this peaceful scene, a sense of unease hung in the air.
Detective Jameson stepped out of his car and onto the crumbling asphalt, his eyes scanning the mansion's facade.  The once-manicured lawn was now a tangled mess, littered with debris and weeds.  The mansion's grandeur lay shrouded in shadows, the windows like empty eyes staring back at him.

Jameson drew a deep breath, feeling the crisp night air fill his lungs.  He was on the case, and he would find the killer.  The old mansion had a reputation for being haunted, but he wasn't one to believe in the paranormal.  He was a rational man with a sharp mind and a keen eye for detail.

As he made his way towards the entrance, the door creaked open beneath his foot.  A chill ran down his spine, but he steeled himself and stepped inside.  The air inside was stale and musty, filled with the scent of decay.

He moved cautiously, his footsteps echoing off the walls.  Jameson had been through this case before, but the mansion still unnerved him.  He was led to the study, where a body lay slumped over the desk.  A silver watch lay on the floor next to it, its face twisted into a grotesque grimace.

Jameson examined the body, taking note of the wounds.  They were severe, consistent with a fatal stab.  The killer must have been close, given the care with which they had consumed the evidence.

"Thanks, Doctor," the medical examiner said, his voice barely above a whisper.  "You'll need a formal statement.  I'll process the scene and get the evidence to the lab."

Jameson nodded, his eyes scanning the room once more.  This couldn't be the work of a grizzly animal, given the precision and calculated nature of the wound.  He was dealing with a human.

As he exited the study, Jameson spotted the path to the kitchen.  He grabbed his phone and stepped inside, calling for backup.  The kitchen was dark and musty, with a faint smell of urine in the air.

Jameson moved quickly, taking note of the layout and potential escape routes.  He spotted a window to the hallway, partially ajar, with an opening reveal of a dark garden.

He turned towards the kitchen, his eyes drawn to a kitchen knife lying on the counter.  It was then that he realized his mistake – this wasn't the killer, this was the killer's work.

"What's going on?" a low voice whispered.  "You're not a clue."

Jameson spun around, hand on the grip of his gun.  He had lost his grip on reality.

"That's not me," he stammered.  "That's a piece of evidence.  I need to assess the situation and—"

His voice trailed off as he gazed upon the keyboard covered in dusty letters.  The fresh air he loved was now tainted with maleficence.

"It's written," a whisper seemed to imply in the shadows, "You're not what you seem."

Jameson spun back to face the window, gun raised.
