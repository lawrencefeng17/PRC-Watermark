**The Shadows of Blackwood Manor**

Detective Jameson stood before the grand, stone façade of Blackwood Manor, the sprawling estate that loomed like a ghostly sentinel over the sleepy town of Ravenswood. He felt a shiver run down his spine as he pushed open the creaking front door, the hinges groaning in protest. The once-peaceful evening air was now thick with foreboding.

The victim lay motionless on the floor, a lifeless body with a single bullet wound to the back of the head. The phone in the study of the manor's owner, the wealthy and reclusive Mr. Blackwood, rang, shrill and attention-grabbing.

Jameson descended the creaking steps, his eyes scanning the grand foyer for any sign of life. A chill breeze rustled the parchment-tufted drapes, casting macabre shadows on the walls. He entered the study, the room was empty, except for a lone figure huddled in a chair by the roaring fireplace.

Detective Jameson, a man in his mid-forties with a rugged face and piercing blue eyes, approached the body cautiously. "Good evening, Mr...?" he requested.

"I'm... Elliot Grant," the man replied, his voice laced with a hint of panic. "One of Mr. Blackwood's guests."

As Jameson began to survey the scene, he noticed a piece of paper on the floor nearby, partially hidden by a nearby bookshelf. Curious, he picked it up, and his eyes widened as he read the despicable handwriting.

"Nothing," he muttered, horrified. "No note, no message, no warning. It's as if they'd simply vanished into thin air."

Intrigued, Jameson asked Elliot Grant more questions, but our guest seemed reluctant to talk, stonewalling him. Jameson's gut told him that something was amiss, but he couldn't quite put his finger on it.

As the night wore on, Jameson interviewed the other guests, but none of them had any clear alibis for the time of the murder. The only living being on the property was the night watchman, Jenkins, who reported seeing nothing unusual.

As the group concluded their interviews, Jameson decided to review the crime scene, searching for clues. He poked his head into the study, taking note of the peculiarities of the room. A cold sense of unease crept over him as he found the vase with the shattered pieces of black marble on the floor. It seemed to seem out of place.

"Vase?" Emmeline, the cleaning lady, asked as she swept the floor. "Sir, I think it was broken nearby."

"Shh," Jameson replied, his radar alert to any signs of wrongdoing. He carefully examined the broken vase and noticed something else - a silvery thread caught in the shattered pieces.

A thread that shone like moonlight in the dim light of the study.

Outside in the garden, a figure emerged from the darkness, dimly lit by a single, oppressive moon. A tall, lean figure clad in black, their face obscured by a hoodie. They didn't seem to be paying attention to Jameson, their eyes fixed on some point beyond the garden.

Was this one of the guests, or a new nemesis?

Jameson watched the figure for several minutes, trying to distinguish between what was real and the flicker of a dream. It was then that he realized he was not the first person to disappear in this spot all night.

7 years ago, three guests had vanished in the same manner. The room had changed, the shadows altered as the figure melted into one of the other Dark Thinx?

 Jameson realized that the shadowy figure might indeed be one of the guests, but what horrific reason would it be? What happened there? He knew he should know. He willed himself to focus.
